# Yes, it's easy to make, but "make" is not enough for your career

Many people recommand todo app as a intro project for a new language or a coding in general. But will it be helpful for your career? As you can see, so many people make their todo app. Making a todo app in a new field seems like a printing a “hello world” these days. Because of that, some might say that including your todo app project to your portfolio is not a good idea.

In some sense, yes, I agree. But I don’t think you should not build your todo app because is so common these day. If you observe this problem carefully, you will find that many of those who build their todo app stop the project after it works properly. I think the problem is this. There’re so much beyond that, but they’re not willing to push a little farther.

# What should you do after your todo app is working

In order to make your todo app really boost your career, think about questions below. They will help you to think and go beyond the “just working” app.

### User Experience : Is this app is easy enough for an real world user?

When I think I’m finished with major feature of the app, I bring the app to a people who are not into tech stuff. For me to sure that this app is worthy enough for real user, I need them to actually use it with no big problems. Oh, this part is hard. I, the maker of this app, of course know every details and how to find and use them, but user who opened this app for the first time, they are not. It’s really important that you can make an app that real user can handle.

Before I decided to make mobile apps, I also didn’t know that and cared about that. But it’s an important point to think if you want to build something to the production level.

### Debugging is not finished yet

When you thought the debugging is finished, that’s when real debugging is start. Before you can proudly say that your app is ready to go on live, you need to test the app with someone other than yourself. Sometime, this process really make you to ask yourself, “Wow, how could anyone think of this kind of way to use this app?” Real world users are more creative than you think. Prepare for unexpected gift(a bug) from your users.

### Do you know how to publish your app?

I think what makes your career little more outstanding is a link of your app. If you’re web developer, a link with a nice domain name that starts with “https” will do that. For an Mobile developer, a link of Google Play Store or Apple App Store will make your project more interesting to anyone who would read your career story, even it’s a simple todo app.

This process is a bit tricky and you may need to spend some money on that(developer registration or hosting fee). But it will bring more value to your skills.

# Conclusion

Now you know that what you can do with your simple todo app, it’s your choice now. I recommend you to go around the full journey. I also did that and it’s on both on Google Play Store and Apple App store. In case if you wonder, what outcome will look like, I’ll leave a link down below. It’s free.
